# Breast Cancer Detection
In this project we try to classify if a tumor is Malignant or Benign based on 31 different variables which we have.

## How to use it:
**Prerequisites:**
1. Python 3.5 or greater. Download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Jupyter Notebook. Instructions to install it, [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
3. Libraries: [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html), [sklearn](https://pypi.org/project/sklearn/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
	
1. Either clone or download this repository
2. Open the directory where you have saved inside the command prompt.
3. type ```jupyter notebook``` inside command prompt to open Jupyter Notebook.
4. Open notebook named "Breast_Cancer_Detection.ipnyb" file.
5. Go to Kernal and select "Restart & Run All" option. By this all the cells will run and you will see output of each one.

There are Markdowns and comments in the notebook for further understanding of what is happening. If you get any errors you can raise issue, and I'll try to resolve it asap.
